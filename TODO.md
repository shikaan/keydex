# kpcli

- when compiling the version does not make into the "info" (it still "deV" when it's a new version)
- the help test is tooo long, better sutied in a manpage
- README
- error handling: error from package and error from command line args are inconsistent
- disable ESC when an "are you sure" modal is open, else it breaks the view
- height of list clashes with bottom bar in tmux (too long)
